# Print guide

The plastic parts are bearing quite some load, so printing them accurately key to a succeessful setup.

### Plastic

ASA is the preferred filament right now, providing generally better rigidity than ABS, especially when kept under load. I have had good success with Prusament ASA.

PC-ABS is an option, will update after testing it.

### Parameters

Use usual [Voron print settings](https://docs.vorondesign.com/sourcing.html#print-settings), plus:

 - 80% infill.
 - Supports on bed plate only.
 - Extrusion multiplier - on point or slightly under. The shuttle and hotend plate have ~0.5 mm clearance between them, overextrusion will cause problems.
 - (optional) Enable ironing.

### Cleanup

You will need to clean up some supports. Ideally if you can print with PETG or soluable supports.

Flush cut pliers , exacto knife and some patience will get them removed just fine.
