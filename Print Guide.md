# Print guide

The plastic parts are bearing quite some load, so printing them accurately key to succeessful setup.

### Plastic

ASA is the preferred filament right now, providing generally better rigidity than ABS while still eary to print. I have had good success with Prusament ASA.

CF-Nylon apparently has creep issues. 

PC-ABS is an option, will update after testing it.


### Parameters

Use usual [Voron print settings](https://docs.vorondesign.com/sourcing.html#print-settings), plus:

 - 80% infill.
 - Supports on bed plate only.
 - Extrusion multiplier - on the point or slightly under. The shuttle and hotend plate have ~0.5 mm clearance between them, overextrusion will cause problems.
 - (optional) Enable ironing.

### Cleanup

You will need to clean up some supports. Ideally if you can print with PETG or soluable supports.

Good flush cut pliers and a exacto knife and some patience will get it removed just fine.
